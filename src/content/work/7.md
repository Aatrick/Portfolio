# Novel Scraper
Here is a novel reader [android app](https://github.com/Aatrick/Novel-Scraper), it's coded in Java and uses the android studio IDE. It's an app that allows me to read novels from the web, without relying on a browser or from normal reading apps that don't include everything. It's a challenging project to work on and I'm always looking for new ideas to implement in it.  

The app also works offline, with pdf files and with raw html files while keeping user's progress and data.
