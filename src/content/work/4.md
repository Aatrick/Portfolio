## DramaQuick

> What is it?

[DramaQuick](https://github.com/Dramaquick/DramaQuick) is a faster version of DramaQuiz; temporary questionnaires, quiz sessions... All of this was created with one idea in mind: ephemerality!

### Which languages were used?

The site is built with Svelte and TailwindCSS for styling, the backend is made with Laravel, and the database uses PostgreSQL.

### Summary

This was a large-scale project that allowed us to discover and deepen our understanding of certain aspects of web application development. It also showed us that basic tools like HTML, CSS, or even PHP could become very redundant during development, and that frameworks like Svelte, TailwindCSS, and Laravel help speed up certain parts. Without these solutions, it would have been impossible to complete the project within the imposed deadline.
