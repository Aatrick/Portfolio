## Randomify

[Randomify](https://github.com/Aatrick/Randomify) is a web application that uses the Spotify web API to play random tracks from a user's playlists. It uses simple communication between the client and the server with the client's ID and secret ID to play a purely randomely selected track from the user's playlists.
