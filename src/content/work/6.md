# Boubou le Hamster
It all started with a simple idea of coding a [discord bot](https://github.com/Aatrick/Boubou) in a class on markov chains having as example Boubou the hamster, sleeping 9/10 of the time, eating 1/10 of the time and running 1/10 of the time. I decided to make it a bit more complex and make it a dynamic status bot, with a probabilistic status, and a chat-gpt integration. It's a fun project to work on and I'm always looking for new ideas to implement in it.
